            As surfers with waves to ride and stories to tell, we are inspired
            to create a special platform for our surfing culture.
            <br />
            However, everything we produce or consume impacts on the environment
            and the truth is, the least impactful way way to make book is to
            just not make book at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            So throughout the entire production process, we have been conscious
            how best to deliver GLASS in a way that is as kind as possible to
            our planet. For us, this means production is fully FSC® certified
            and carbon-neutral, simply put, we pay more to use paper from a
            forest that is managed carefully and offset emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the crowdfunding campaign has allowed us to gauge demand for
            GLASS more accurately than expensive market research ever could. We
            have printed only what we honestly believe we can sell to genuine
            readers and this tight print run and our direct to reader model will
            keep waste at a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lifespan of any product is important and the longevity of GLASS
            is no different. Each edition will be expertly designed and curated
            to build into a collectible series which we hope will be appreciated
            for years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often products get damaged during shipping, which decreases
            viability whilst increasing waste. Therefore, all packaging we use
            will be the best environmental option we have found so far to get
            the book in readers hands in perfect condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a book, not a magazine, GLASS does not rely on ad revenue to
            exist. This means the book can have real editorial integrity and can
            talk openly about challenging subjects without turning advertisers
            off.
          </p>

              It’s not perfect, but the truth is, we use the best eco practice
              we can afford to create a platform to explore environmental ideas
              that other media often ignore.
