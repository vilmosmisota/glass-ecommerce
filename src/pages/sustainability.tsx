            Everything we produce or consume impacts on the environment and the
            truth is, the least impactful way to make book is to just not make
            book at all.

            However, as surfers with waves to ride and stories to tell, we are
            inspired to create a lasting and meaningful platform to reflect our
            surfing culture. So, throughout the production process, we have been
            conscious how best to deliver GLASS in a way that is as kind as
            possible to our planet. This means all the paper we use to produce
            and distribute the book is from renewable sources. Simply put, we
            pay more to use paper from a forest that is managed carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the crowdfunding campaign has allowed us to gauge demand for
            GLASS more accurately than expensive market research ever could. We
            have printed only what we honestly believe we can sell to genuine
            readers and this tight print run and our direct to reader model will
            keep waste at a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lifespan of any product is important and the longevity of GLASS
            is no different. Each edition will be expertly designed and curated
            to build into a collectible series which we hope will be appreciated
            for years to come.
          </p>

            Often products get damaged during shipping, which decreases
            viability whilst increasing waste. Therefore, all packaging we use
            will be the best environmental option we have found so far to get
            the book in readers hands in perfect condition.
          </p>

            As a book, not a magazine, GLASS does not rely on ad revenue to
            exist. This means the book can have real editorial integrity and can
            talk openly about challenging subjects without turning advertisers
            off.

              Itâ€™s not perfect, but the truth is, we use the best eco practice
              we can afford to create a platform to explore environmental ideas
              that other media often ignore.
