          <p>
            We value your support and therefore offer all postage and packing at
            reduced rates. We despatch all copies with the Royal Mail and use
            recycled and FSC materials.

          <h2>Delivery Times</h2>
          <p>
            The standard domestic delivery time in the UK is 5-7 working days
            <br />
            We will always aim to meet these timeframes but there may be
            occasions outside our control when your parcel is delayed.
            <br />
            Once your order has been dispatched we are unable to change a
            residential delivery address.
